# DS-C_B-Half-Car-Rig-Analysis

The main document of reference is the [documentation.mlx file](documentation.mlx) which runs through the process of determining the natural frequencies of the system as well as their mode shapes. this information is then used along with a [simulink model](x4DOF_Model.slxc) to conpare experimental data with simulation to draw conclusions about the test rig and the methods used.

## To Run
- Clone the git repository
- Open the [documentation.mlx file](documentation.mlx) with MATLAB 2023A and either run the whole file or read through the sections, pressing the run button when it appears to run that specific part of code
